# CRaTER dose equivalent rates for individual and combined detectors
#    from DATE
# through DATE

# All dose equivalent (DE) rate units: cSv / day
# All dose rates have a silicon to water correction applied and are altitude corrected to the lunar surface.
# Description: Dose equivalent rates measured by the CRaTER instrument aboard LRO. Included are dose equivalent rates for each thin/thick# detector pair. D1-D3-D5 are thin detectors and D2-D4-D6 are thick detectors. Thin/thick detectors are more sensitive to high/low energies# and are combined to obtain a dose equivalent rate which spans the energy range of the instrument. In the computing of each thin/thick detector# pair dose equivalent rate, overlap is eliminated between the two detectors. Also included are dose equivalent rates for each of the six individual# detectors. Every dose equivalent rate shown here has been multiplied by three factors which are shown in this file: the H2O Factor, the# Altitude Factor and the Good Event (GE) Factor. The H2O Factor is a constant factor of 1.333 which converts the silicon dose# measured by the detectors to a water dose. The Altitude Factor normalizes the measured dose equivalent rate to the surface of the Moon# (i.e. 2*pi exposure where half the sky is blocked). The Good Event factor takes into account the fact that during periods of# high activity (solar energetic particle events) particles are streaming through the instrument at a rate that is too high for# all the particles to be measured. A separate mechanism in CRaTER is able to measure the total number of events (both measured# and unmeasured) and so the GE Factor is the ratio of the total number of events to the number of measured events. All of these# factors have already been applied to the dose equivalent rates shown here and all dose equivalent rates are in units of cSv/day.
